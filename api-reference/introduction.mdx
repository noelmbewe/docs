<Note>
  This documentation provides a complete reference for integrating with the
  One-Khusa Payment Gateway. Youâ€™ll find details about authentication,
  batch transactions, single transactions, and supported schemas.
</Note>

## Welcome

The One-Khusa API enables developers to build secure payment solutions,
manage batch payouts, and track single transactions in real time.  

We provide two main ways to explore the API:  

- **OpenAPI specification** (auto-generated docs with full request/response details)  
- **MDX components** (customizable explanations and use cases)

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using **Bearer tokens**.  
When making requests, include your token in the `Authorization` header:  



```json
"security": [
  {
    "bearerAuth": []
  }
]
```
